# leonddarko-about-me

Hi, I’m @leonddarko.

👨🏽‍💻 A Full-Stack Web Developer and I enjoy the web. I also do some Flutter development as well.
I don't joke with my front-end development, and I dont shy away from the backend either.
I always do the very best I can.
  
🌱🤓 I’m currently learning and working on becoming a Blockchain (Web 3) Developer.
  
🤩🤝🏽 I’m looking to collaborate on Web Development projects with anyone who is interested.
Feel free to reach out. I'll do my best to get back to you.
